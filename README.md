This is a repository of the fundamental algorithms, most of which are given the textbook "Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS. The implementation and documentation were done by myself (Kumara Sri Harsha Vajjhala).
There are also few interesting problems and their solutions which are not part of the CLRS book.
